Hi there!
My name is Iva Garlova and during the spring of 2023 I`ve started my journey with coding.
I choosed JS without any idea  of what will happen and if I am going to succsseed in this new world for me. Well it turned out that I fell in love with it, and I am so keen of learnig, practising and developing my new skills.
I am a very social and funny type of person.
I love reading and laughing the most.
But most important - I am the working one! I am the person who considers herself  being lazy,but at the same time, the truth is - I can`t leave something undone, or halfdone.
